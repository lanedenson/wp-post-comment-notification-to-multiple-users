wp-post-comment-notification-to-multiple-users
=====================================================

Wordpress Plugin - send an email to multiple addresses when a new comment has been submitted.

This is a Wordpress plug-in that has seemingly been abandoned.  There was some undocumented functionality causing issues in the original version that I cleaned out.  The original plugin is available at http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-comment-notification-to-multiple-user/
